 BlackRack currently consists of 2 phases:
     컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
     Phase I  - General Computer Diagnostic Program
     컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
        Tests memory, disk drives, BIOS, etc., with
        diagnostics report via comm port to MacIntosh .

        16 out of 18 diagnostic modules completed as of Nov 15, 1991.

        컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
        Testing at TOP :
        컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
        October 31, 1991:
        컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
           1) Async communications to MacIntosh partially successful.
           2) All diagnostic modules successful.

           CONCLUSIONS: 
               1) Reduce size of error/diagnostic messages to Mac.
               2) Implement an error/diagnostic message lookup table rather
                  than xmitting verbose messages between the 2 computers.
               3) Present communications between 2 computers utilizes NO
                  handshaking/protocall - therefore message length & speed is
                  critical.

        November 13, 1991:
        컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
           1) Async communications to MacIntosh COMPLETELY successful.
           2) Error/diagnostic message lookup table format approved by
              Blackrack personnel.

           CONCLUSIONS: 
               1) Due to the Computer Diagnostic Program's modular nature,
                  it can be delivered in a useful form with only a subset of
                  intended diagnostic tests completed. (Currently 16 of 18 are
                  completed.)
               2) Async communications to MacIntosh COMPLETELY successful. This
                  was 100% verifiable via a newly implemented Comm Port
                  Tracking file, in which all commands sent to Comm port were
                  recorded. This was then compared with the Mac's recorded
                  input.
               3) Async communications satisfactory for CDP, but will need to
                  involve handshaking for Blackrack Phase II.

                  Async knowledge gained on this code will be 100% applicable
                  to Phase II.
                  
     컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
     Phase II - RS232 Communications Diagnostic Program
     컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
        2 PC's communicate across comm port, with diagnostics
        reported via a 2nd/3rd comm port to MacIntosh.

        START: Upon completion of Phase I.

        Estimated completion 4 weeks from start date.
