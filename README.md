# Code for review by SAIC

I have uploaded several source files from different projects I have worked on over the years.
Even though there are other files present under a given directory, the files mentioned below will probably be of the most interest.

## Files of interest, organized by company I worked for at the time ...

> Company: **Scientific Games International**
>> Paysafe.cpp

     Part of a payment gateway used for Sports Betting and other financial funding of wagering accounts.
     This code was written in C++ as an extension to the PHP server. 
     It was written in C++ to provide greater control over security issues and also speed.
     
>>> You will probably also want to look at the files under the "/Paysafe/" subdirectory.
     
     At SGI, we used a SCM tool called "BitKeeper".
     You may notice a string similar to this at the top of each file:
          "// BitKeeper: jdeen@anya.gamelogic.com|lib/Ecommerce/ExternalProviderApi.h|20160301232156|34444"
          
     Which, in this case, merely indicates that jdeen was the last person to check in this code. 
     It does not necessarily indicate original authorship.
     
> Company: ***Enfotrust***
>> Snoopy.cpp

     A multi-threaded server running as a Windows service.
     
     Snoopy allowed field techs to connect to those big lights you see in shopping malls and office parks.
     It was used to download operating statistics and other data from the lights. Other services were used to control the lights.
     
> Company: ***SITA***
>> **Project:** *Wafer* ("Windows Airfare FRont end")

     Server to read air fare field data and serve a GUI front end interface instead of the 
     old fashioned green screen text terminals you would see at the airline terminals of the time.
     
     We wrote the code to successfully compile on either Windows or a Unisys mainframe.
     
>> **Project:** *ScriptGen*
     Read air fare field data files and generated scripts for use by air fare agents
