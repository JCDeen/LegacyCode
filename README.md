# Code for review by SAIC

I have uploaded several source files from different projects I have worked on over the years.
Even though there are other files present under a given directory, the files mentioned below will probably be of the most interest.

## Files of interest, organized by company I worked for at the time ...

>> Snoopy.cpp

     A multi-threaded server running as a Windows service.
     
     Snoopy allowed field techs to connect to those big lights you see in shopping malls and office parks.
     It was used to download operating statistics and other data from the lights. Other services were used to control the lights.
